## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

PopMov is a simple web application that fetches data about popular movies from the TMDb API and displays them in a visually appealing format.
It allows users to see a list of 100 most current popular movies, including their titles, images, and overviews.

The project consists of the following components:

- Server-side: An Node.js server that fetches data from the TMDb API.
- Client-side: An HTML page styled with CSS and a JavaScript file that handles fetching and displaying the movie data.
